# VIBE Rules

1. **SECURITY FIRST.** Always verify your codes' security. Don't ever allow even a small possibility to make a single tiny vulnerability across the codes, configurations, and supply chains.
2. **Strictly follow Conventional Commits for commit messages.**
3. **This app strictly follows Content Security Policy (CSP) Level 3.** Don't ever write inlined-css or inlined javascript in any chance.
4. **This app supports i18n.** Don't ever write hardcoded UI texts but always use .NET Localization framework.
5. **Do functional programming,** but make sure don't harm readability and maintainability.
6. **Before implementing a feature, make sure NOT to make duplicated codes.** Always keep the entire structure of the project in mind.
7. **Make commit per feature.** That doesn't mean you can commit per session and contain all features implemented in the session at once. commit per "feature".
8. Before making a commit, always verify whether the change broke functionalities or not.
9. Always write appropriate tests and verify. 
10. **Don't use `alert` or `confirm` or `prompt` for displaying messages or getting user input.** Use Toast UI or overlay instead.
